This is an awesome file 12 added directly from GitHub.com
And now i am about to commit directly to GitHub.com remote repository
This is not somethong we would do normally
We are just trying simulate a situtation where remote repository is ahead of local rep history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
